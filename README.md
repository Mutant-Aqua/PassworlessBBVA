# FIDO Register & Login DEMO

This project is a FIDO2 DEMO that can be used for register and authentication purposes under the FIDO2 paswordless standard.
The FIDO server has been built using Python with an specific opensource module which includes all the functions to work with the standard. This module can be installed using pip.
The fronted has been build using VueJS in conjuction with vuetify.

Furthermore, the whole project has been dockerized and it can be built using docker-compose.

> If you don't know about passwordless, check our posts in the [BBVA Next Technologies blog](https://www.bbvanexttechnologies.com/category/labs/). There, you can read the first of two post about passwordless: [Passwordless: el fin de las contrase√±as](https://www.bbvanexttechnologies.com/passwordless-el-fin-de-las-contrasenas/). The next one, Construyendo tu aplicaci√≥n passwordless, will be ready soon and we will explain there all the FIDO2 protocol messages.

## Init üöÄ
